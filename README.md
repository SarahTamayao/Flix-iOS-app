### Notes
I am still finding it a little tricky to configure auto-constraints. But I'm really liking the way Storyboard organizes screens, esp. the tree org. we learned. I am working through the trailer add-on, and I feel like I'm close but just need to understand how to pass the data.

### Notes
I think I just have to spend some time learning the syntax and environment â€” dealing with Swift optionals as well as knowing what code goes in what section are my two main challenges right now.
Other than that, I think I have a good grasp of the generic template for table views and custom cells.
